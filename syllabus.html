  <h5>Required Supplies & Equipment</h5>
  <p>Being that the course focuses on web development and design techniques, regular access to a computer is required. A modern text editor is recommended; see the "Resources":/resources.html page for some of my personal favorite text editors.</p>

  <h5>Ethics & Conduct</h5>

  <p>In a perfect world, this section of the syllabus wouldn't exist.  There are truly only two words worth mentioning here:  *respect* and *honesty*.  All I ask is that you treat myself and your fellow students with the respect with which you would wish to be treated yourself.  By the same token, I also ask that you display honesty when completing in-class assignments and work outside of class.  </p>

  <h5>Attendance</h5>

  <p>Attendance is mandatory in order to foster diverse class discussion and allow for constructive in-class teamwork.  Arriving late, leaving early, or failing to attend a class will adversely affect your grade.  Students are allowed one excused absence per term to allow for illness or personal circumstance. Subsequent absences will result in a 5% reduction in your final grade.</p>
