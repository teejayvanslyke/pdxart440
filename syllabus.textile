h5. Required Supplies & Equipment

Being that the course focuses on web development and design techniques, regular access to a computer is required. A modern text editor is recommended; see the "Resources":/resources.html page for some of my personal favorite text editors.

h5. Ethics & Conduct

In a perfect world, this section of the syllabus wouldn't exist.  There are truly only two words worth mentioning here:  *respect* and *honesty*.  All I ask is that you treat myself and your fellow students with the respect with which you would wish to be treated yourself.  By the same token, I also ask that you display honesty when completing in-class assignments and work outside of class.
